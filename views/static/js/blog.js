    <br><br>1.	SEO is an acronym that stands for search engine optimization, which is the process of optimizing your website to get organic, or un-paid, traffic from the search engine results page. ... Search engines want to provide the best service for their users. In other words involves making certain changes to your website design and content that make your site more attractive to a search engine. You do this in hopes that the search engine will display your website as a top result on the search engine results page.
                                                       As we all know Search engines want to provide the best service for their users. This means delivering results on the search engine pages that are not only high quality but also relevant to what the searcher is looking for.
               It works by this way, the search engines will scan the site to determine how easy it is to navigate and read, rewarding user-friendly sites with higher rankings on the search engine results page. 
    Now the question is HOW DO YOU DO SEO FOR A WEBSITE? Some steps of good basic SEO are: 
    <br>•	Find relevant keywords with good search traffic potential.
    <br>•	Create and optimize pages for search engines and users alike.
    <br>•	Make sure your website is accessible to both bots and humans.
    <br>•	Build relevant links from other high-quality websites.
    The basics of SEO are quite simple. But the basics aren’t enough to get you ranked, right? Well if you think that then you are wrong. Most people who run websites have a limited understanding of SEO, so you often only need to get the basics right to succeed.
    <hr>
    •	Step-01) Find relevant keywords with good search traffic potential.
        
    <br>a)	Learn what your customers are actually searching for:
               For example- hotels in Gujarat, accommodation in Gujarat, place to live in Gujarat these are the two ways a potential user can search for your business and there are more for it too.
               <br>b)	 Find popular and engaging topics related to your field:
              For example- use the keyword “Gujarat hotel” So when user will search top 10 Gujarat Hotel or Gujarat hotel list your chances increase for suggestion in your user list.
              <br>c)	Expand your keyword list by looking literally at other platforms:
            A simple way to start is to look at Google autocomplete results. Repeat this step and get more results by adding each letter of the alphabet. For example: If you search Gujarat hotel then you might get suggestion in search bar like best, cheap, top rated etc. start adding these suggestion in your key word list. You can find more suggestion from QUORA, FORUMS, REDDIT, Facebook OR LINKEDIN GROUPS
            <hr>
            •	Step-02) Create pages optimized for search.
    Keyword research is only the first step towards attracting more organic search traffic. Optimization of the page should be in a way that the user should enjoy the interface. 
    <br>a)	 Create content that aligns with ‘search intent’: only step -01 is not efficient for your attractive SEO there are factor called search intent which consist of these three products 
    <br>	NAVIGATIONAL- Looking for specific website “fitnesswithgomzi.com” 
    <br>	INFORMATIONAL- looking to explore or learn on a particular topic “things to do in Gujarat “
    <br>	TRANSACTIONAL- majorly of purchasing something or spending money on “book hotel in Gujarat”
    <br>NOTE - SEARCH INTENT isn’t always crystal clear from the search query itself. “My hotel is the best hotel in GUJARAT, so this is probably a transactional term for which YOU can rank YOUR homepage,” right? No not really.
     Google’s algorithm keeps a close eye on the behavior of people searching for a particular term and tries to offer results that will meet the intent of their search. Thus, you can infer search intent by looking at the commonness between the current top-ranking pages.
     <br>b)	Use short, descriptive URLs:
     <br>URL structure should be as simple as possible. Consider organizing your content so that URLs are constructed logically and in a manner that is most intelligible to humans 
    For example- “domain.com/Gujarat-guide”
    <br>c)	Create appealing meta titles and description:
     Meta title tag does not appear anywhere on your page. It merely sets the name of the browser tab, and Google and other search engines use it when showing the page in search results. Also, Google doesn’t always respect the title tags you set. They sometimes choose to display something slightly different.
    Title-tag serves as a great opportunity to write a headline which is appealing enough to make user click your website and for the keywords that rank your page.
    Also, we recommend you to use 60 or less than 60 characters in description to avoid truncation in full search result. 
    Meta titles are important mainly because they too can affect the click-through rate, which helps you know about the traffic rate on your site.
    <br>d)	 Set up Schema:
    <br>Schema is a tool which helps you to add ratings of your offerings and making your website more attractive and noticeable or we can say eye catchy.
    <br>•	Step-03)  Make sure your website is accessible to both search engines and humans
    
    <br>Always remember that you’re working for two separate customers—your human readers, and the bots search engines use to index your website while you’re doing your SEO.
    Since bots are evolving more like humans you need to differentiate between them your goal should be to create a positive experience for both humans and bots. Creating pages optimized for bots can be challenging. We recommend you to prefer a web-developer for the same
    
    <br>a)	 Make sure your website loads fast:
    <br>A study concludes that 30% - 40% leave the website if it takes more than 3 seconds to load so speed of loading your website plays a major role too. You can use GOOGLE’S PAGESPEED INSIGHT tool or GTmetrix which will provide you the information about how much time your website takes to load and provide you the suggestions for the same as well
    <br>b)	 Make sure your website is mobile-friendly:
    In current times we can’t say that if everyone has a laptop or not but almost each and everyone have a smart phone at-least. If we talk about facts and figures approx. 60% of the searches were done through smart-phones. You can use Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test tool, to check whether your site is mobile friendly or not.
    <br>c)	 Install an SSL certificate:
    HTTPS is officially one of the ranking signals Google uses, you can tell when a site uses SSL because there’ll be a padlock in the URL bar. SSL certificate can also be a security issue especially when you’re doing e-commerce business or accepting form submissions this can lead to information leak and other security breaches too.
    You can use free options like “Let’s Encrypt” allow you to secure your website without making you spend a single penny for the same.
    <br>d)	Create a sitemap:
    It is an XML file which lists all the pages on your site. Search engines use it to find your content and understand how your pages are connected (i.e., see the overall structure of your website). Also, Sitemaps do not affect rankings directly, but they allow search engines to find and index new pages on your website faster.
    •	Step-04) Build backlinks from other websites:
     if you’re prepared to spend resources (time, money, etc.) on producing content, you should also be prepared to commit at least as much time to promoting and generating links to your content.  Because there’s clear evidence showing that backlinks are one of the factors with a strong influence on Google’s ranking algorithm. There are many tactics you can use to get other websites to link back to your web pages, before you start working on it review how your competitors are building their link it is important because even a small change can be useful and each and every competitor has their own tactics.
    •	Step-05) Tracking your SEO success:
    To check or track the performance there are many methods and metrics which can make you confuse but you should focus on the basic.  If we actually talk about tracking SEO we should consider a) organic traffic, and b) the average ranking position for the keywords you’re targeting.
    <br>a)	 Measure organic traffic:
     Using GOOGLE ANALYTICS you can see it from 
    Acquisition > All Traffic > Channels > Organic Search
    <br>b)	The average ranking position for the keywords you’re targeting:
    Keyword rankings refer to your web page's position within search results for a particular keyword search query. When a user searches for the particular keyword, your ranking URL would be the web page that is listed for that keyword search. One web page can rank for several relevant search keywords and phrases.
